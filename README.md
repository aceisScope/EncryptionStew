# EncryptionStew
encryption methods used for iOS version of Social PaL and OmniShare, Aalto University

### ECKeyPairManager
Key pair manager singleton class for elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH). ECDH key generation based on [GMEllipticCurveCrypto](https://github.com/ricmoo/GMEllipticCurveCrypto) from Richard Moore

### RSAKeyPairManager
Asymmetric key pair manager for RSA keys in iOS. A working version of RSA2048.


### AES GCM
AES in GCM mode. Since GCM mode is not supported by CommonCrypto Framework, OpenSSL is used. How to include and compile OpenSSL for iOS, please refer to its documents.


### KeyGenerator
Key generator includes:

1. a function to random generate 20-Byte key to be used for HMAC SHA1 or MD5

2. a key derivation function based on PBKDF2.

3. a HMAC SHA1 function with inputs and key in NSData format. Note most of the current solutions on SO for NSString+HMAC can only takes NSString as the key parameter, however if the key is a random generated byte array it's not practical to convert it to NSString.

### Secure Remote Password wrapper for iOS
Based on [csrp](https://github.com/hoccer/csrp) by Tom Cocagne from Hoccer GmbH.
The structure, algorithm and values mentioned in the codes are from a compatible Python module called [pysrp](http://pythonhosted.org/srp/srp.html). Please refer to this man page for notations.
It requires OpenSSL as the only dependency.

SRPClient is a class for SRP client side.

1. It generates I and A, then sends them to server(host). Alongside A it also creates an instance of `SRPUser`
2. It receives salt and B, generate session key and M
3. It sends M to host, receives H(A,M,K) and verifies if session key matches that in host

SRPHost is a class for SRP host(server) side.

1. It generates salt and a password verfier
2. It receives A from client, generate B and seesion key. Then sends salt and B to cliet. Alongside B it also creates an instance of `SRPVerifier`
3. It receives M, verifies if session key matches that in client, and sends H(A,M,K) back to server

#### Sample Usage
```objective-c
    const char * username = "testuser";
    const char * password = "password";

    const char *identity = 0;

    const unsigned char *byte_A = 0;
    const unsigned char *byte_B = 0;
    const unsigned char *byte_s = 0;
    const unsigned char *byte_M = 0;
    const unsigned char *byte_HAMK = 0;

    int len_A = 0;
    int len_B = 0;
    int len_s = 0;

    [[SRPClient client] generateClientByteAWithPassword:username andPassword:password];   // -------- step 1

    byte_A = [[SRPClient client] getABytes];
    len_A = [[SRPClient client] getALength];

    identity = [[SRPClient client] getIdentity];

    [[SRPHost host] generateSaltAndVerificationWithIdentity:identity andPassword:password];    // -------- step 2
    [[SRPHost host] generateSessionKeyWithBytesA:byte_A lengthA:len_A];            // ----------- step 3

    byte_B = [[SRPHost host] getBytes];
    len_B = [[SRPHost host] getBLength];

    byte_s = [[SRPHost host] getSaltBytes];
    len_s = [[SRPHost host] getSaltLength];

    [[SRPClient client] generateSessionKeyWithBytesB:byte_B lengthB:len_B salt:byte_s lengthSalt:len_s]; // -------- step 4

    byte_M = [[SRPClient client] getMBytes];

    int isHostVerified = [[SRPHost host] verifySessionWithBytesM:byte_M];  // -------- step 5
    NSLog(@"host verify %d",isHostVerified);

    byte_HAMK = [[SRPHost host] getHAMKBytes];
    int isClientVerified = [[SRPClient client] verifySessionWithBytesHAMK:byte_HAMK];  // -------- step 6
    NSLog(@"client verify %d",isClientVerified);
```
